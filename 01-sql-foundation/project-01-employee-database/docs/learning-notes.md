# My Learning Journey

## Day 1: Departments Table
- Learned CREATE TABLE syntax
- PRIMARY KEY makes each row unique
- NOT NULL means value is required
- Insert adds data, SELECT views it

## Day 2: Employees Table  
- FOREIGN KEY connects tables
- JOIN combines data from multiple tables
- DATE data type for dates
- GROUP BY for calculations (AVG, SUM)

## Day 3: Projects Table
- More practice with foreign keys
- NULL values in databases
- Working with date ranges

## Day 4: Bridge Table
- Many-to-many relationships
- Bridge tables have composite primary keys
- Complex JOINs with multiple tables

## Day 5: Locations
- ALTER TABLE modifies existing tables
- UPDATE changes existing data
- Adding columns as needed
